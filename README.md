## What Am I?

> That's another thing

Due to my academic education, in addition to my personal training, the limits of my abilities are not very well defined.
For this reason, I have projects in several and very different fields of application.

## Detailed

### University Carrer
My academic degree is Electronic Engineering, currently in development, in my last year and near to finish.
You can see a copy of my current analytic document at the following link.

### Investigation
I am a member of BHI Research where I carry out developments related with Machine Learning or AI. You can see papers in which I participated in the following link.

### Argentina Navy
I have worked (currently in development) as an intern in the Argentine Navy for more than a year,
developing dedicated software in related with my Professional Internship and Final Degree Project,
and debugging its operation in multiple operating systems connected to dedicated equipment.

### Teaching Assistant
I was teaching assistant, in the annual subject of the first year of Electronic Engineering, "Informatics I",
where the fundamental concepts of programming are presented. The following is a copy of my designations.

### TICs Professor
Since the beginning of last year, I have been an ICT teacher, at the secondary level, at Colegio Puerto del Sur.
There, I teach children between 12 and 14 years old (first and second year of high school) in several topics related to Computer Science,
Editing, Programming and Robotics.

### Christian
Leaving the merely technical,I am a member of Ágape Iglesia, an evangelical Christian church,
where I participate in social activities and integration and development, of multiple aspects.

## Projects

### Electronics
My academic degree is Electronic Engineering, as a student at the UTN, Bahía Blanca Regional Faculty. Therefore, I have developed several projects linked to this branch.

### Programming

Since the beginning of my career in the world of technology (starting as a high school student in the specialty of Electronic Technician, at the age of 16) I have felt a deep interest in everything related to programming. I started developing in C and Python, before seeing it formally during my degree. A couple of years later, looking for some economic income, I learned to develop WEB pages, an activity to which I dedicated myself for a while.

#### Python

 - [PSO-JAX](https://github.com/joelermantraut/PSO-JAX)
 - [WhatsMatic](https://github.com/joelermantraut/whatsmatic)
 - [Spotify Playlist Parser](https://github.com/joelermantraut/spotify-playlists-parser)
 
#### Desarrollo WEB
 - [HDJ Website](https://github.com/joelermantraut/hdj)
 - [My Own Website](https://github.com/joelermantraut/je)
 
### Computer Science

Although my interest is mainly focused on Electronics and Programming, circumstances have led me to have to acquire other skills, linked to the Computer Science branch, especially those related to operating systems.

#### Linux

On this system, I have experience with multiple distros, especially those based on Debian, and Arch Linux.
